### Guidelines

- Each team will consist of 7 members
- You can divide the work equally among the members.
- Currently this repos will have two languages - JAVA and Python,
- Can discuss with the team and proceed with prefeered language.
- In your repository, there will be two files,
  - Calculator.java - will contain JAVA base code

### Best Practices
